formats, such as JSON, YAML and HTML.

It supports both a file name as input and a piped ('|') input which might be useful
on more involved shell scripts.

For example:
    ./plist json -i myfile.plist
    ./plist json | cat myfile.plist

For individual commands instructions run:
	./plist [command] -h
	./plist json -h

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
